# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The data is sourced from two tables, `CovidDeaths$` and `CovidVacinations$`, and various queries provide insights into infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress.

## Project Structure
- **SQL Code:**
  - The main SQL code is available in the `sql-scripts` directory.
  - Queries cover a range of analyses, including filtering and ordering data, calculating death percentages, and assessing infection rates relative to population.

- **Results:**
  - The results of the queries can be found in the `output-results` directory.
  - Data visualizations and further analysis can be performed using the generated CSV files.

## Setup
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Ensure you have a SQL Server instance set up.
   - Create a database named `PortfolioProject` and load the COVID-19 data into tables named `CovidDeaths$` and `CovidVacinations$`.

2. **Execute SQL Queries:**
   - Run the SQL queries in the `sql-scripts` directory on the `PortfolioProject` database.
   - Use a SQL Server Management Tool or execute the queries programmatically.

3. **Review Results:**
   - Explore the results generated by the queries in the `output-results` directory.
   - CSV files provide structured data that can be used for further analysis or visualization.

## Notes
- The SQL queries are designed for exploration purposes and may require customization based on your specific data and database structure.
- Ensure that the necessary database permissions are granted before executing the queries.
- The project assumes familiarity with SQL and a working SQL Server environment.

Feel free to adapt and expand the project based on your requirements and explore additional aspects of the COVID-19 data.
